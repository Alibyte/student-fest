Feeling stuck on what to build next? Here are some project ideas categorized by difficulty level to help spark your creativity and enhance your skills.

## 🌱 Beginner Project Ideas

Perfect for your first or second project. Focus on fundamentals.

1. **Personal Portfolio Website**: Create a simple, static HTML/CSS website to showcase your skills, projects, and contact information.
2. **Simple Calculator**: Build a calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) or as a command-line tool that performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
3. **To-Do List Application**: A web or console app where you can add tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them.
4. **Random Quote Generator**: An application that fetches a quote from a simple API or a local file and displays a new one on each button click.
5. **Digital Clock**: A simple web page or desktop widget that displays the current time and updates every second.

## 🌿 Intermediate Project Ideas

For those comfortable with a programming language and ready to tackle more complex features.

1. **Weather Application**: Fetch data from a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and display the current weather and forecast for a user-inputted city.
2. **Real-Time Chat Application**: A simple chat room where multiple users can communicate in real-time using WebSockets.

1. **Build a Simple Programming Language**: Create a custom interpreter or transpiler for a small, dynamically-typed programming language.
2. **Create a Simple Web Framework**: Develop a lightweight, server-side web framework (like a mini-Express or Flask) with routing and middleware.
3. **Develop a Simple Database System**: Build a key-value store or a simple relational database from scratch that can handle basic CRUD operations and persistence.
4. **Build a Basic Operating System**: Create a minimal operating system kernel that can boot, handle keyboard input, and print to the screen.
5. **Create a Neural Network from Scratch**: Implement a simple neural network library that can be used for basic machine learning tasks like image classification on the MNIST dataset.
